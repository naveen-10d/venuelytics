                    <h3 >1. Technology Innovation</h3>
                    <p>Technology and the type of innovation used in the tool plays a vital role and being the owner of the venue you don't want to get left behind using the old technology anymore. Always think, your customers are smarter than you, so you have to be well aware of the trending and upcoming technologies that can quickly get the work done rather than focusing on something just because it is cheap and out of trend. Choose your event management tool such that it focuses on the solution quickly and also a technologically advanced one. Nowadays AI (Artificial intelligence) is playing a big part in such products and tools. So be aware of such intelligent tech trends and the tools that utilize such advancements.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Trust</h3>
                    <p>Trust is a big factor when it comes to choosing your event management tool. Make sure the tool has a well-maintained website or an app if they have one. Also, check out the testimonials if possible to see if any other big guys/venues are already using them. Know the tool better by going to different review platforms and also compare the prices and features. Choose the one that is affordable and has some credibility online. You might also check their social profiles to see if they are up-to-date, any recent announcement or future plans. </p>

                    <h3>3. Ease of use</h3>
                    <p>When we say technology, it doesn't have to be a complex one. Technology that should be easily understandable, accessible, and usable and the same applies to any event/venue management software. Most of the venue owners and managers will have less idea of the technology, so the challenge is to choose something that is advanced as well as easy to use with some training.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Expected growth</h3>
                    <p>You can forecast the anticipated growth to a certain extent when you go for any event management tool depending on the features and support the platform/tool provides.

                    <h3>5. Support</h3>
                    <p>Support and service should be the primary focus you should be looking for while selecting an event management tool. Check out the reviews about the tool on different review websites and see what people are talking about their service. Choosing a tool that is flexible enough to support and help you grow is a crucial point. </p>

                    <h3>6. Unique features</h3>
                    <p>Make sure the tool you select has some unique features that might help increase your revenue. Compare with other tools in the market and conclude picking the extraordinary one that suits your budget. Some tools might showcase added features, but what if they are not any use for you, that will be a waste of money.</p>

                    <h3>7. Testimonials</h3>
                    <p>You should make sure there are already people using the tool, not just any people but someone whom you can trust looking at their profile. You should see the testimonials on the website and review sites. You should see what type of people are using it, what are their views on the tool. This will give you some idea of whether to choose the tool or not. </p>
