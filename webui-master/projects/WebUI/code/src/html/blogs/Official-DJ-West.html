                    <h5>1. Hi DJ West, can you please introduce yourself to our audience at VenueLytics &amp; ItzFun App (Venue Management &amp; Digital Concierge Solution)?</h5>
                    <p>I go by OfficialDjWest. I am a professional disk jockey and a young entrepreneur who is known for captivating a crowd no matter the venue with a variety of music and a unique style of mixing that keeps the audience on their feet and/or tuned-in whether it be on the dance floor, internet or F.M. dial. </p>

                    <h5>2. How did u get into djing?</h5>
                    <p>I started DJing when I was approximately 16 years old. My uncle bought me my first pair of turntables and my grandparents helped me pay for the rest of the equipment. It started as a hobby that turned into a money-making passion.</p>

                    <h5>3. Is there any reason you call yourself the “KingoftheParty”?</h5>
                    <p>I have assisted and saved a lot of events for other DJs. My mixing style is completely different from the norm and no matter the venue, genre or time, I have the capacity to make people smile with the music I play.</p>

                    <h5>4. What single night out has been the most memorable for you as a DJ?</h5>
                    <p>The night I met my girlfriend has been the most memorable for me as a DJ. I was DJing at a hookah lounge and after words she came up and asked for my snapchat. I believe when you focus on your dreams then god will put the right people in your life to get you where you need to be.</p>

                    <h5>5. Who/what inspired you to become a DJ?</h5>
                    <p>My mother’s love for music is what inspired me to be a DJ. Music runs in my family so it was destined for me to be DJ.</p>

                    <h5>6. What makes you decide to play a particular record during one of your sets?</h5>
                    <p>I look for records that can strike an emotional nerve in the crowd that I am playing for. If I can connect with the crowd on an emotional level, then I can control them.</p>

                    <h5>7. What is your most favorite part of being a DJ?</h5>
                    <p>My favorite part about DJing is being able to put a smile on people faces. I see people fall in love just off of the right song at the right time. This is what brings me peace in life.</p>

                    <h5>8. Can you name some of your favorite nightclubs?</h5>
                    <p>Honestly, even though I am a DJ, I am not much of a party go-er. I was the person that was never invited to parties or functions. Much love to the promoters and club owners that have booked me to spin at their venues.</p>

                    <h5>9. What advice do you have for someone who wants to become a DJ?</h5>
                    <p>My advice to someone becoming a DJ is to never stop doing what you love regardless of what life throws at you. I know what it is like to have nothing and still be the kingoftheparty. Make it happen. You can do it. </p>
