                    <h3>Nyeelah</h3>
                    <p>Honestly when I got into nightlife, it kind of fell on my lap from just going out every week..nightclubs have always been my escape it where I come alive. I would hear stories about how amazing nightlife was in the 80s and 90s, I would hear stories about Susan Bartsch and her amazing parties that everyone who was anyone was dieing to attend.. she was and still is a beast in this business.. She is my muse</p>
                    
                    <h3>VenueLytics</h3>
                    <p>Where are some of your favorite places/clubs in NYC?</p>
                   
                    <h3>Nyeelah</h3>
                    <p> I can name these below ones<br>
                        The Box<br>
                        Public Hotel<br>
                        Happy Endings<br>
                        Lebain Rooftop
                        </p>
                    <p>I don't call them my favorite places i call them my second  home</p>
                   
                    <h3>VenueLytics</h3>
                    <p>What is so great about NYC Nightlife?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Nyeelah</h3>
                    <p>The great thing about NYC Nightlife is that you meet people from all walks of life (Bankers,Models, Priest,Chefs, Designers etc) we all party together and forget the world, in other words, escape from the real world.. Nothing feels better than getting text messages from people tell you they had an amazing time and that you made them feel good..That makes me smile every time</p>
                    
                    <h3>VenueLytics</h3>
                    <p> How challenging is it to be a nightlife promoter?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Nyeelah</h3>
                    <p>Being a promoter is extremely challenging, especially now since the business has become so saturated with sub promoters, everything has become about money, cover charge at most of the upscale manhattan nightclubs has escalated from $20 to $60/$80 per person or large groups are required to buy bottles..bottle service is literally killing NYC Nightlife</p>
                   
                    <h3>VenueLytics</h3>
                    <p>What can you tell us about nightlife trends in NYC?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Nyeelah</h3>
                    <p>The growing trend is that nightclubs are now paying hot girls to hangout in the nightclubs this has been happening for a while but now it's at its peak..60% of the hot girls in the nightclubs are paid to be there.. which isn't fun for them and it's not what nightlife is about to the blind eye no one would be able to tell but I can spot it from a mile away..never the less I am in love with NYC Nightlife. I have made some amazing connections and friendships that have changed me and my life.. because of NYC Nightlife I have promoted the hottest Nightclubs in Paris France and Los Angeles California..</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Hope you all enjoyed this interview and let us know if you also into nightlife industry, we would like to interview and promote you on our blog and social channels.</p>
