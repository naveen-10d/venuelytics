                    <h3>Facts you must know about Concierge services</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Most people don’t take help of the hotel concierge, and it’s apparently because they just don’t know all that these hospitality experts can do to help them. Concierges have years of experience, good insider knowledge, and a vast network of connections that can make your stay more successful and enjoyable.</li>
                        <li> After you check-in to the hotel or any venue, head over to the concierge and introduce yourself. If you know you’re going to need extensive help from your concierge while your stay, call or email the concierge a few days in advance.</li>
                        <li>Don't be shy to seek out and ask for help. Concierge experts are very helpful and they aim to please guests, provide best services possible and to ensure guests have a experience.</li>
                        <li> If you have a special need or request, a concierge can extend considerable support—like calling taxis, finding English-speaking doctors, and recommending restaurants that can accommodate specific food allergies.</li>
                        <li>They can help get you a table and bottle service. All these venues will usually find a way to fit in guests who are recommended by their preferred concierge contacts. If the restaurant/lounge/nightclub is indeed full, the concierge can often get you to the front of a waiting list.</li>
                    </ul>
