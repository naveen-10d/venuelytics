                    <p>Mayes Oster House is a restaurant by day and dance club by night. Located on Polk Street in San Francisco, California, the restaurant uses VenueLytics to pack the house and increase its bottle service offerings. "Prior to VenueLytics, we took down reservations manually on slips of paper or through text messages, which would get lost," noted Mayes Oyster House general manager and bar aficionado, Sabrina Vera.  "It was very sloppy."
                    </p>

                    <p>The first step for Mayes (something all restaurants, bars, clubs, and entertainment venues should do) was list their venue on the "ItzFun!" mobile app. Venues can do this by going to >LINK.>  The ItzFun! app, <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/venuelytics-for-business/id1155767700?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_new">available in the iPhone app store</a>, is an entertainment application for consumers who wantÂ to know what the happening and fun venues are nearby, and at that moment! Users can find out the current vibe of bars, clubs, lounges, casinos, and more nearest to them. They can see real-time information about venues, like crowd population, gender ratio, specials, crowdsourced information, dress codes, and more. They can even see if there's a line to get in and if the venue is a premium member, they can pay to skip the line.
                    </p>

                    <p>When a user finds what they like, in this case Mayes Oyster House, they will notice that as a premium member, services like VIP bottle and table reservations, and even private event booking, are available right from the app on their iPhone. The customer can click on the table they want and select a bottle to have waiting on ice upon arrival.
                    </p>

                    <p>"To say we use VenueLytics is a bit of a misnomer. It implies that we do something to interact with the platform, added Vera. "We don't actually 'use' anything as the bottle and table requests are automatically sent to us.  It's effortless."</p>

                    <p>When requests come in, both Vera and Matt Higley, the bar owner, are "pinged" by the app.  Matt is usually very busy and often can't get to these requests, but Sabrina, who is off site in the bar office, can more easily respond, which means customers get answers quickly and requests don't fall through the cracks.
                    </p>

                    <p>"For example, when we open our VenueLytics app, the ORDERS icon is highlighted, indicating there are new requests and when opened, it automatically populates and shows the list of these requests.  Pulling up the app now, the first item that appears says: Jackie's bottle service request - total guests: 17, notes special requests, the event type, a contact number, and email address. From there, we take this information, book the reservation, and send confirmation. If for some reason we can't meet the request, we'll suggest alternatives.  By knowing the event type (in this case a birthday party), we can provide a special touch like a cake, a gift, or a simple birthday greeting," added Vera.
                    </p>

                    <p>When customers use the app, they have the opportunity to choose the table and bottles they want to reserve. The app opens a floorplan, providing pictures so they can see where they will be seated and what they are getting. When they make a reservation, they can also choose to be added to the venue's mailing list.  "We continue to build the list to provide loyal customers with specials and first dibs on popular items. We also have a few VIP tables that are very popular here, so those tend to go first," said Vera
                    </p>

                    <p>Vera says at first, she was a bit reluctant to use the technology, knowing it would be challenging to implement a modern solution at an establishment that has worked the same way for years, but that the VenueLytics team was, "amazingly helpful, supportive and totally on top of everything." I'm not sure that I would not have kept going if they didn't continue to push us in the right direction."
                    </p>

                    <p>In the end, Vera says the restaurant is thrilled they moved forward with the solution as they are already seeing the fruits of their labor. "VenueLytics laid out what we could expect and it happened exactly as they said it would," said Vera.
                    </p>

                    <p>Vera is now involved in opening a new bar and club in the financial district and will be looking to use VenueLytics to book large parties and leverage some of the other premium features.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you are looking for a night on the town, count up your friends and pick the bottles you want ahead of time and send Mayes Oyster House a request. They'll save the good table for you!<br/>
