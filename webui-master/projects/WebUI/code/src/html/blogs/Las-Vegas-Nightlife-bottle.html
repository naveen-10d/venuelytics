					 <p>Nobody really knows what happens in Vegas because everything that happens there, stays there.  But rumor has it that Las Vegas is the Disneyland for grownups.  Again, that is just a rumor!  You have to experience that on your own.</p>
					 
                    <p>If you decide to see what Vegas nightlife is all about, we recommend you go there with a group of likeminded friends that like to cure their hangover by the pool during the day and party at night.  The rumor has it that the best way to experience the nightlife in Vegas is by ordering bottle/tables service.</p>
                    
                    <p>It makes sense to have a bottle/table service and spread the costs among the group. In return, you and your friends can experience a true VIP night out in Las Vegas for any occasion occasion like a bachelor party, bachelorette party, birthday party, etc. You can book your table/bottle service via ItzFun app and save time.</p>
                    
					<p>The bottle/table series vary in price and depend on the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Day of the week</li>
						<li>The Venue â€“ DJ, Celebrity appearance, special events</li>
						<li>What you order: services costs between $350 and $575 per bottle.</li>
						<li>Day of the week</li>
						<li>Day of the week</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					<p>Some of the best nightclubs that serve bottle/table service include HAKKASAN, DRAIS, 1OAK, TAO, CHATEAU, SURRENDER, INTRIGUE. As always we recommend you use ItzFun to look for venues and book your next VIP table/bottle service. </p>
