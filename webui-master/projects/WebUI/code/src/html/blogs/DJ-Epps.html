                    <h5>1. Hi DJ Epps, can you please introduce yourself to our audience at VenueLytics &amp; ItzFun App (Venue Management &amp; Digital Concierge Solution)?</h5>
                    <p>I go by the world-famous DJ Epps from Miami Florida raised and born in Harlem New York City representing all my Haitians </p>

                    <h5>2. At what age did you start Djing and how it all started for you?</h5>
                    <p>I started Djing at the age of 15 listening to Dj red alert, funkmaster flex and watching Ed Lover &amp; Dr. Dre on yo MTV Raps.</p>

                    <h5>3. What are some of the challenges in becoming a successful DJ in Miami?</h5>
                    <p>Staying relevant keeping up-to-date with the young youth and being better than my friendly competitors.  Managing yourself could be very tough but once the ball starts rolling in the money starts coming in you should be able to maintain it.</p>

                    <h5>4. According to you, what are some of your favorite venues (nightclubs, pubs, casinos) in Miami?</h5>
                    <p>I've been to them all but Cameo, LIV, once club dream, Playhouse gentlemen club,  and a couple low-key spots in Wynwood.</p>

                    <h5>5. What is your daily routine? How do you usually start your day and how it ends?</h5>
                    <p>Taking the kids to school, coming home getting on my laptop taking care of my social media's and my bookings.  Go have a corporate meeting for lunch, then picking the kids back up from school.   then heading at night to the studio session or a nightclub Booking and hopefully some sleep to do it all again.  LoL.</p>

                    <h5>6. Any suggestions for anyone who is inspired to become a DJ?</h5>
                    <p>Stay motivated stay humble stay on your grind keep Hustlin don't let nobody stop your shine stay away from hater's and negativity and you will be OK.</p>
