					 <p>The Big Apple is best known for its nightlife and dining experience.  It offers entertainment and nightlife venues that city barely sleeps.  New York City is also home to many celebs, DJs, music artists, etc which add to the nightlife glamour</p>

					<p>When it comes to the nightlife, there is a long list of venues in New York City. 
					However, here are some venue that we recommend - Tao Downtown Nightclub, Flash Factory NY, Up Stairs, 5th and Mad, Electric Room club NYC, and 230 Fifth.</p>

					<p>Cost of bottle/table service in New York City, Bottle service prices start at around $100 â€“ $130 per individual. <br>
					Exclusive and popular nightclubs are more expensive as they host well-known entertainers and DJs. Bottle/table services typically cost anywhere from $200 to a $1,000 per individual at these venues.
					</p>
					<p>But if cost is not an issue, the higher price is well worth the VIP experience in New York.</p>  
					<br><br>
					<p>As always we recommend you use ItzFun to look for venues and book your next VIP table/bottle service. </p>
